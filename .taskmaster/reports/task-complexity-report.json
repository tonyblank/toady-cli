      "taskTitle": "Implement GitHub CLI Integration Layer",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the GitHub CLI integration layer into subtasks covering: 1) GitHubService class structure and initialization, 2) gh CLI detection and version checking, 3) authentication status verification, 4) subprocess wrapper implementation with proper error handling, and 5) comprehensive error handling for various failure scenarios",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple complex components including subprocess management, error handling for various failure modes, version compatibility checks, and creating a robust service layer abstraction. The integration with external CLI tools adds complexity."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Data Models for Review Threads and Comments",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the data model implementation into: 1) Create ReviewThread dataclass with validation and serialization methods, 2) Create Comment dataclass with validation and serialization methods, and 3) Implement comprehensive unit tests for both models including edge cases",
      "reasoning": "While conceptually straightforward, this task requires careful design of data structures, proper type hints, validation logic, and serialization/deserialization methods. The complexity is moderate due to the need for robust error handling and edge case consideration."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Fetch Command for Unresolved Review Threads",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the fetch command into: 1) Create click command structure with parameter parsing, 2) Design and implement GraphQL query for unresolved threads, 3) Implement gh CLI execution logic, 4) Parse and transform API responses to model objects, 5) Implement output formatting (JSON and pretty), and 6) Add comprehensive error handling and validation",
      "reasoning": "This task is complex due to GraphQL query construction, API interaction through gh CLI, response parsing, multiple output formats, and extensive error handling requirements. It also depends on multiple other components."
    },

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Reply Command for Review Comments",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the reply command into: 1) Create click command with parameter validation, 2) Implement REST API call via gh CLI for posting replies, 3) Add input validation and error handling for various failure scenarios, and 4) Implement success confirmation and response handling",
      "reasoning": "This task involves REST API interactions, parameter validation, error handling for multiple failure modes, and proper response handling. The complexity is moderate but requires careful attention to API details and user experience."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Resolve Command for Thread Management",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the resolve command into: 1) Create click command with thread ID and undo flag parsing, 2) Implement GraphQL mutation for resolving threads, 3) Implement GraphQL mutation for unresolving threads, 4) Add logic to determine and execute appropriate mutation, and 5) Implement error handling and success confirmations",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing two different GraphQL mutations, conditional logic based on flags, proper error handling, and state management. The complexity comes from the dual nature of the command and GraphQL mutation construction."

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and Validation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Organize error handling into: 1) Create custom exception hierarchy and error classes, 2) Implement validation functions for all input types, 3) Add try-catch blocks and error handling to all commands, and 4) Create user-friendly error messages and exit code system",
      "reasoning": "While not algorithmically complex, this task requires systematic implementation across the entire codebase, careful design of exception hierarchy, and consideration of all possible error scenarios. The cross-cutting nature adds to its complexity."
    },

      "taskTitle": "Implement Output Formatting and Pretty Printing",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide output formatting into: 1) Create base formatter interface and JSON formatter implementation, 2) Implement pretty formatter with color and table support, 3) Add format selection logic to commands, and 4) Test formatting with various data structures and edge cases",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a flexible formatting system with multiple output options, color support, and table formatting. The complexity is moderate, focusing on clean design and handling various data structures."

      "taskTitle": "Create Comprehensive Help Documentation and Usage Examples",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Organize documentation tasks into: 1) Write comprehensive docstrings and help text for all commands, 2) Create examples.md with common usage patterns and troubleshooting, and 3) Generate man page documentation and ensure consistency across all help content",
      "reasoning": "This is primarily a documentation task requiring clear writing and organization skills rather than technical complexity. The main challenge is ensuring completeness and clarity across all documentation."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Unit and Integration Test Suite",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Structure test development into: 1) Set up pytest framework and test structure, 2) Create unit tests for models and utilities, 3) Implement unit tests for commands with mocked APIs, 4) Develop integration tests for real API interactions, 5) Create test fixtures and data generators, and 6) Set up coverage reporting and CI/CD configuration",
      "reasoning": "Testing is complex due to the need for both unit and integration tests, mocking external dependencies, creating comprehensive test data, and achieving high coverage. The variety of test scenarios and setup requirements adds significant complexity."
